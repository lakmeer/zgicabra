## Sixense SDK Linking

`src/hydra.rs` depends on `libsixense_x64.so` which in turn depends on
`libstdc++.so.6`. Both of these are kept in the `libs` folder and copied to 
the build target folder during build. Additionally, `libsixense_x64` has been
`patchelf`'d to modify it's rpath to `$ORIGIN`, rather than using the system
default.
